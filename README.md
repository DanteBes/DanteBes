# ðŸ‘‹ Dante Besfalin

Hi! My name is Dante Besfalin. Iâ€™m a programmer and web developer. I started my development journey in 2019, and Iâ€™ve been working with design and video editing for over 7 years.

## ðŸ’» Skills
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS.
- **Design and Video**: Creating videos and graphics, working with graphic editors.
- **Content**: Building websites on various topics (Genshin Impact is one of my inspirations).

## ðŸ”¥ Current Projects
- **Portfolio Website**: Iâ€™m currently working on my own website, where Iâ€™ll showcase my projects and blogs.
- **Genshin Impact**: Creating guides on artifacts, builds, and game mechanics, including topics like artifacts and attacks.

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Information
- I love adding creative elements to my projects, such as Easter eggs and animations.
- Iâ€™m always learning and experimenting with new approaches in programming and content creation.
- I work using SPCK Editor on a mobile device, as I donâ€™t have access to a full development environment on a PC.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Continue developing as a programmer and content creator.
- Build more complex projects while improving my web development skills.
- Support projects that help people with disabilities.
